            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee would have you to be assured that we never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the least neglect unto you in any former summons of the Country, Our love, as well as Our protection, extending to all Our Subjects; But as you are a great Body, time and conveniency must bee observed in your Assembling.</p>
            <p>That you may know the generall Reasons of Our being here, you must understand, That when Wee found it neither safe nor Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to expose Our Person to the tumultuous and licentious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of many (which to this day are unpunished) who did disorderly approach neere Our Court at <hi>White-hall,</hi> We trusted this part of Our Dominions chiefly to reside in; where, as most of the Gentry already have, so We assure Our selves the rest of you will give Us cleere testomy of your service and obedience, which Wee will never use otherwise then for the defence of the true Orthodox Religion professed and setled in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Authority of the Statutes of this Realme, the defence of the Lawes and fundamentall Constitutions of this Kingdome (as the justest Measure and Rule for Our Prerogative, and your Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Rights) and lastly, for the preservation of the Peace of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>As for Our owne Zeale to the Protestant Profession, We referre all the world to Our daily exercise of, and Our Declarations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and execution of the Lawes against the Papists; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise We cannot but declare Our selfe most heartily sorry to finde such Separatists, and Schismaticks, who presume, against Law, to
<pb facs="tcp:110185:3"/> foment new Doctrines and Disciplines to the disturbance of Church and state.</p>
            <p>For the Law, it being the common inheritance of Our people, we shall never enforce any Prerogative of Ours beyond it, but submit Our selfe to it, and give you and all our Subjects the fullest lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of it, both for the liberty of your persons, and the propriety of your estates. And for an inviolable confidence and assurance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as We take God (the searcher of all hearts) to witnesse Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all intention herein, so Wee shall no longer desire you to stand for the defence of Our Person Honour, and just Prerogatives, then We shal maintain the Laws of the Land, the liberty of your persons, and the propriety of your goods.</p>
            <p>And for the cleare understanding of Our Resolutions to maintain peace, We may have the confidence and happinesse to refer (against all malignity whatsoever) to Our former sixteen years Reigne; (too long to dissemble Our Nature) if in all this time Wee never caused the effusion of one drop of bloud, it must needs be thought; that in Our riper judg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ment in Government, Wee should never open such Issues as might drown Vs and Our posterity in them; But Wee are sure to have no enemies, but in the defence of the true Protestant Profession, the right of the established Laws, and for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of peace &amp; certainly al these must be yours, as wel as our enemies.</p>
            <p>And to the end that this present posture wherein We meet should not affright you, with the distempers of the times, the example of the two Houses having made Vs prepare for a guard to Vs and Our Childrens Persons, We wish you to looke into the Composition &amp; Constitution of it, and you will find it so far from the face or feare of War, that it serves to secure you, as well as Vs, from it; For Our Choice is of the prime Gentry, and of one Regiment of Our Trained Bands, which cannot be thought to oppresse the Countrey (being their own) nor war with themselves. And Wee further assure you, Wee never intended to use Forreighners, or disaffected in Religion: And that You may fully assure Your selves of Our sole dependency upon the love and service of Our own people, to live and dye with them, We have armed these Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which had been most irrationalll, if We had ever intended to have used Strangers. And further, you may perceive that Wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none, but such as stand cleare in Loyalty and Religion, for which reason We have caused the Oaths of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
<pb facs="tcp:110185:3"/> to be given them. Likewise, to prevent any distempers at home, We have, and shall put the Trained Bands of all this Our Kingdome under the command of Persons of Honour, confidence &amp; affection to their Countrcy; straitly charging, upon their Allegiance no Officer to accept any command in them, nor Souldiers to obey any save such as are authorised by Us.</p>
            <p>And for the prevention of any innovated power over you, you shall have Vs here to governe you, and the Souldiory to protect you in peace, and to relive you against all oppressions; for that as Wee have told you before, must arise from some great violation (which We hope God will prevent) and not from this preparation of Our Subjects. Therefore let none of you be affrighted with vaine feares if such a war should follow, it follows the Authors home to their own doores; and such (by the confidence of Our Person with you) We assure Our selfe you are not.</p>
            <p>Here We had left you to your fidelity and duty, had not some malicious insolence in Our former meetings sent forth most presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Summons, deceiving our people, and presuming upon Our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yall Authority; and these present themselves as great defenders s, of Religion, peace, and Liberty; Whereas they become infectiou and contagious to the people, seducing them into vaine fancies and delusions, as may appeare by their warrants which Wee could trace to some Pulpits, as we are credibly informed: And you see it were just in Vs, to punish these Authors of sedition, but that it would bee too great a favour, for it would honour them with the Title of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, for Gods cause, as they vainely pretend: But you may now see from whence this Spirit comes, that would make Vs to be in the Act of destruction of Religion, Our Person a disturber of the Peace, and ready to introduce slavery.</p>
            <p>These here are all the forraigne Forces we have, or ever shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have to act these great designes, notwithstanding the vaine feares hitherto imagined. So that you see it is high time that these fancies were dispersed and driven away, that We might bee repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Honour and Interrest, and you enjoy the blessing of Peace and Happinesse, the advancement whereof shall bee Our study and comfort: and therefore We shall (when you shall thinke it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time) ease you in the number of the Trained Bands. And for your Billet-Money, it had bin long since paid, but that no part of the
<pb facs="tcp:110185:4"/> Subsidies (which We passed for that purpose) came to Our hands, and We shall not be wanting in any thing that lyeth in Us for the full satisfaction thereof: And shall make Our Grace and bounty to you answerable to your best fidelity and loyalty, as occasion shall be offered to us.</p>

In which hopes we are further encouraged by this dayes triall in the Citie, finding, besides the Trained Bands thereof, a like number of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers well and compleatly armed, who are ready to make ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
